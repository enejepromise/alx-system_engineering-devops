A server is a powerful computer program running on a dedicated computer system.

Key Components and Their Roles
Domain Name: A domain name serves as a user-friendly address for a website, replacing the need to remember complex numerical IP addresses.

DNS Record for "www" in www.foobar.com: The "www" part is typically associated with a CNAME record (Canonical Name record).

Web Server: A web server functions as an intermediary between your web browser and the website you are trying to access.

Application Server: Positioned between the web server and the database, the application server manages the "behind-the-scenes" logic of the website. It processes user input, interacts with the database, and generates customized web pages based on user interactions.

Database: A database stores information in an easily accessible, organized, and modifiable manner.

Communication Protocol: The server uses the TCP/IP protocol suite to communicate with the user's computer requesting the website.
