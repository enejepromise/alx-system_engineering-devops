Postmortem: Web Application Outage
Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:
Start: October 15, 2023, 10:30 AM UTC
End: October 15, 2023, 11:45 AM UTC

Impact:
The web application experienced a complete outage, affecting approximately 70% of users. Users reported that they were unable to access the service, receiving a "503 Service Unavailable" error. Key functionalities, including user login, data retrieval, and API access, were rendered unusable during this period.

Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which led to an uneven distribution of traffic among the application servers, ultimately overwhelming the few servers that were still operational.

Timeline
10:30 AM UTC: The issue was detected when automated monitoring systems flagged increased error rates across the application.
10:32 AM UTC: An engineer on duty confirmed the alerts and began investigating the server logs to identify the root cause.
10:40 AM UTC: Initial assumptions pointed to a potential server overload, prompting an investigation into server resource utilization and health checks.
10:50 AM UTC: Customer complaints began flooding in through support channels, emphasizing the severity of the outage.
11:00 AM UTC: The investigation shifted focus to the load balancer configuration after noticing significant discrepancies in traffic distribution.
11:15 AM UTC: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team as the engineering team required more specialized expertise.
11:30 AM UTC: The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.
11:45 AM UTC: The load balancer was reconfigured, normal traffic distribution was restored, and the application was fully operational again.
Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the outage was identified as an incorrect setting in the load balancer that directed excessive traffic to only two of the five available application servers. This configuration error resulted in those servers reaching their maximum capacity, while the remaining servers were largely underutilized.

To resolve the issue, the DevOps team corrected the load balancer settings to ensure an even distribution of traffic across all application servers. This required updating the health check configurations and load balancing algorithms to better manage incoming requests during peak times.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements to be made:

Review and update the load balancer configuration processes to include more rigorous testing before deployment.
Enhance monitoring tools to provide more granular insights into traffic distribution and resource utilization across servers.
Specific Tasks:

Audit Load Balancer Settings: Conduct a thorough review of all load balancer configurations to identify potential misconfigurations.
Implement Load Testing: Create automated load tests that simulate high traffic conditions to assess the performance and configuration of load balancers.
Enhance Monitoring: Add alerts for traffic distribution metrics to ensure immediate detection of similar issues in the future.
Documentation Update: Revise internal documentation regarding load balancer configurations and best practices to prevent future misconfigurations.
Team Training: Schedule a training session for the engineering and DevOps teams on load balancing best practices and monitoring techniques.
